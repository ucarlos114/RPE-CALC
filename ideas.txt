ideas on how to gather data important to determining RPE:

velocity of lift
duration of lift
number of reps (does this matter to an extent?)

----------------------------------------------------------

POSSIBLE METHODS OF DETERMINING VELOCITY OF LIFT:

STARTING POINTS:
SQUAT: from the turnaround point out of the hole
BENCH: from the turnaround point off the chest
DEADLIFT: from the floor until motionless at the top

ENDING POINTS:
SQUAT: motionless at the top
BENCH: motionless at the top
DEADLIFT: motionless at the bottom

time portion:
need to determine the frame in the video at
which the starting moments above begin. keep a counter of how
many frames until the ending point. using the frame rate of the
camera we can determine the length of the lift. we can test this
to make sure it is reliable

angles portion:
we could use the current rate of change of the angles (for example across 10
consecutive frames) to determine whether a lift has begun/ended or not. we
could also use an absolute point to determine whether lift has begun or ended,
i.e. once hips angle is greater than 85 degrees for over 5 frames on deadlift
we can tell the lift has started.

velocity portion:
idk i need to ask couch if the angular velocity matters or if its just the speed
if we are doing human body detection it will come down to tracking certain points in
relation to each other

*************************************************************************************************
OH SHOOT I JUST HAD GOOD IDEA WE COULD TRACK THE BODY POINT CLOSEST TO THE BAR LIKE THE HANDS FOR
DEADLIFT AND BENCH OR THE SHOULDERS FOR SQUAT this might have made things a lot easier lol but this
really depends on if the video is shaky or not idk i will figure this out tomorrow

OTHER NOTES:
need to ensure that we are only doing this for the last rep,
will require more problem solving

find a way to count the number of reps in a set

----------------------------------------------------------

BACKUP PLAN: find a way to do image detection to find where
the bar or plates are, and gather the velocity that way
