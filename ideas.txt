ideas on how to gather data important to determining RPE:

velocity of lift
duration of lift
number of reps (does this matter to an extent?)

**********************************************************

TODO NEXT:
find a method of determining when the lift begins, when it ends
even better, record the duration of each rep, storing them separately
to be able to compare the change in rep duration throughout the set

Boolean value motion set when rom starts increasing?
how to tell when it ends at the top

once we can determine the actual duration of the lift,
we can calculate the average angular rate of change for both
the hips and the knees, as well as the rate of change
of the bar position.

**********************************************************

POSSIBLE METHODS OF DETERMINING VELOCITY OF LIFT:

STARTING POINTS:
SQUAT: from the turnaround point out of the hole
BENCH: from the turnaround point off the chest
DEADLIFT: from the floor until motionless at the top

ENDING POINTS:
SQUAT: motionless at the top
BENCH: motionless at the top
DEADLIFT: motionless at the bottom

----------------------------------------------------------

OTHER NOTES:
need to ensure that we are only doing this for the last rep,
will require more problem solving

find a way to count the number of reps in a set

----------------------------------------------------------

BACKUP PLAN: find a way to do image detection to find where
the bar or plates are, and gather the velocity that way
